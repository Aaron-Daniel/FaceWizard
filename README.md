# integration-demo

## What Is It?
A simple web page to demonstrate integration with Veritone Developer framework.

Characteristics:
* Serverless SPA (single-page app): The app is just a static web page with static resources, hosted on a CDN. No server-side logic. 
* Plain vanilla HTML+JS+CSS. No frameworks will be used. (E.g. no Angular, no React, no Vue, etc.)
* For easy hosting and continuous deployment, we will use Netlify to hoist the app onto the web, straight from Github.

This is a work in progress.
